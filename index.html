			<!-- 3. when clicking a message, provide some method showing that row -->

			<!-- 4. each row should have its own rows showing
				date
				sender
				subject
 -->
 			<!-- we can use the same method we did for the out-of-this-world assignment.doing mouseovers and mouse out


 			-->
			<!-- 

				these should be placed in the javascript
				we can use these event listeners to click something and show the properties. below is an example for mouseovers

				//mouseover
				var subtitle = document.getElementById('subtitle');
				subtitle.addEventListener('mouseover',function(){
					subtitle.style.backgroundColor = '#FFA1A1';
				});

				//mouseout
				//change the color back to white
				//it's called a call back function
				subtitle.addEventListener('mouseout',function(){
					subtitle.style.backgroundColor = 'inherit';
				}) -->


 			<!-- 5. You must show an inbox count somewhere on the page to show the current number of messages in your inbox. -->

 				<!-- we can do this by inputting the value of the message.length and inserting it to display where ever we want 

 				something similar to:
 				message.length
 				assume message will be made into an array of objects
 			 -->

 			<!-- 6. Set a recurring function to via the JavaScript setInterval function that will call our existing getNewMessage function that we have created for you that will return a newly created message with the same properties as your previous messages. -->

 				<!-- need to call the getNewMessage from js -->

			<!-- 7. All CSS styles should be created in the css\style.css file included in the project. -->

				<!-- css is used for styling
				*in this case we will position each message
				to look a certain way
				*we also will change the look of the message when the mouse hovers over it, until clicked. -->


			<!-- 8. All JavaScript should be created in the <head> element in your included index.html file inside of the window.onload function already created in the <head> section. -->

				<!-- *do we add our own js to the mail-generator or create a new js file to make it seperate? -->

			<!-- 9. Commit your code often and when you are completed send us a pull request from your repository so that we may review your code. -->
