// this page will help me with my thought process

//Q.1 ask to fork the repository, which i did and then cloned it

// Q.2 
//We will create a header in the body with the name
//Gee-mail
//Create a Div, this is where the messages will be displayed

//Q.3
//there will be a window.geemails variable
// it will look something like this
//var window.geemail={};

//there will be more than one object
//each object will have the properties:date,subject,sender,body,
// an object with those properties can be displayed like so
// we will assume the objects will be the message

message={
	date=();
	subject=();
	sender=();
	body=();
};

//we know that there will be an array for each property
//but don't push array all in one message
//each sequences of arrays will have it's own message

//we need to create a function that generates messages
//enough messages to match the amount of text strings
///******

//we will create a for loop 

//that will generate as much messages as needed
//the amount of text  strings will determine amount of messages 
//the loop will also go through the arrays
//we can push the sequence of array each of their own message
